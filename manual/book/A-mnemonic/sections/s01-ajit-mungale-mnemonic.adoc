=== Popular Mnemonic from Ajit Mungale's article

Interesting mnemonic for the design patterns is available on internet from a post in 2003.  I was able to find reference to thisarticle from 2003 and then it is copied and published in many articles.  The real origin of this mnemonic is unknown.

==== Creational Patterns

* Abstract Factory: Creates an instance of several families of classes
* Builder: Separates object construction from its representation
* Factory Method: Creates an instance of several derived classes
* Prototype: A fully initialized instance to be copied or cloned
* Singleton: A class in which only a single instance can exist

Mnemonic: ABFPS (Abraham Became First President of States). (((Mnemonic, ABFPS)))

==== Structural Patterns

* Adapter: Match interfaces of different classes
* Bridge: Separates an object’s abstraction from its implementation
* Composite: A tree structure of simple and composite objects
* Decorator: Add responsibilities to objects dynamically
* Façade: A single class that represents an entire subsystem
* Flyweight: A fine-grained instance used for efficient sharing
* Proxy: An object representing another object

Mnemonic: ABCDFFP (((Mnemonic, ABCDFFP)))

==== Behavioral Patterns

* Mediator: Defines simplified communication between classes
* Memento: Capture and restore an object's internal state
* Interpreter: A way to include language elements in a program
* Iterator: Sequentially access the elements of a collection
* Chain of Resp: A way of passing a request between a chain of objects
* Command: Encapsulate a command request as an object
* State: Alter an object's behavior when its state changes
* Strategy: Encapsulates an algorithm inside a class
* Observer: A way of notifying change to a number of classes
* Template Method: Defer the exact steps of an algorithm to a subclass
* Visitor: Defines a new operation to a class without change
