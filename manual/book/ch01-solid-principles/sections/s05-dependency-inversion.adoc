=== Dependency Inversion Principle

(((Dependency Inversion Principle)))
Dependency users should not create dependencies, but should reference the dependencies as interface references.
The dependencies shall be injected by the calling context.
This principle makes the objects loosely coupled and testable.

==== Basic Components

----
interface IDependency
class DependencyImpl
class DependencyUser
class Application
IDependency <|.. DependencyImpl
IDependency <--* DependencyUser
IDependency <-- Application
DependencyImpl <-- Application
DependencyUser <-- Application
----

==== Example Without DI

[plantuml, dependency-without-injection, png]
----
class Repository
class Controller
class Order
class Application
Repository <--* Controller
Order <-- Repository
Order <-- Controller
Order <-- Application
Controller <-- Application
