=== Patterns

Patterns is a concept introduced by Christopher Alexander,footnote:[Christopher Wolfgang Alexander is a British-American architect and design theorist. His theories about the nature of human-centered design have affected fields beyond architecture, including urban design, software, sociology and others. Alexander is regarded as the father of the pattern language movement.] and is widely accepted in the software community to document design constructs which are used to build software systems.
Patterns provide a structured way of looking at a problem space with the solutions which are seen multiple times and proven.
