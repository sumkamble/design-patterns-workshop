== Factory Pattern

=== GoF Definition

Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.

=== Things to note about Factory Pattern

* This pattern caters to creation of objects of specific interface/class, let us call it `Product`
* The term interface is referred as a generic concept that is a contract expressed for the calling code to expect in the `Product`
* Factory or Creator class is used to create the objects of the specific interface
* The concrete implementation which is returned from the `Factory` method is not known to the calling code

=== Loose Coupling
(((Factory, Loose Coupling)))
Factory pattern can help achieve loose coupling between components.

`IAuditor` interface declares the expectation contract of an Auditor object.

----

The `AuditorFactory` class decides which concrete Auditor class to instantiate.  This separates the decision of which Auditor to use from the actual calling components.

The decision of choosing a specific auditor can be externalized as a property declaration or even an environmental variable declaration in the `AuditorFactory` class.

=== Encapsulation using Factory
(((Factory, Encapsulation)))
Factory can encapsulate complex logic of building the service.  The logic of creating additional dependencies and building the `IClaimCalculator` is encapsulated in the `ClaimCalculatorFactory`
